# Modelling of the operation of a gas compressor station

Source wolfram code for the paper *"Modeling gas compressor station operation to minimize fuel costs for surge zone protection"*

### To run calculations follow the instructions below:

1. ---> run code in the file _calculateFunctionsForCSRegime.nb_

2. ---> run code in the file _calculateProceduresForCSRegime.nb_

3. ---> run code in the file _globalVariablesHours.nb_

4. ---> run code in the file _SGERG-88.nb_

5. ---> run code in the file _totalHoursComputations.nb_

6. ---> open file _data/output/dataset.xlsx_

The calculation results will be shown as plots in the file _totalHoursComputations.nb_, and the calculation results will be written to _data/output/dataset.xlsx_.

### Example output plots:
