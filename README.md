# Mathematical modelling compressor unit

Source wolfram code for the paper "Modelling of compressor station operation to minimize fuel gas costs" 

### To run calculations follow the instructions below:

1. ---> run code in the file _calculateFunctionsForCSRegime.nb_

2. ---> run code in the file _calculateProceduresForCSRegime.nb_

3. ---> run code in the file _globalVariablesHours.nb_

4. ---> run code in the file _SGERG-88.nb_

5. ---> run code in the file _totalHoursComputations.nb_

6. ---> open file _data/dataset.xlsx_

The calculation results will be shown as plots in the file _totalHoursComputations.nb_, and the calculation results will be written to _data/dataset.xlsx_.

### Example output plots:

A description of all computational procedures is presented in the file _description.nb_.

NOTE: The input data for the calculations were not included in this repository due to privacy policy, but examples of filling in the data are in the _data_ folder.
